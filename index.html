            <h3>Why Lagos</h3>
            <h2>Lagos, the city full of live and lesuire</h2>
            <p>
              There is never a boring moment in this city, which has a lively
              nightlife, an abundance of natural sights, local and foreign
              eateries, and a loud and worldwide famous entertainment scene. It
              is well-known for being Nigeria's most costly city, but it also
              has a thriving art and music scene. With so many entertainment
              options and things to do, each experience is certain to be
              one-of-a-kind. Is it thus worthwhile to pay a visit to this city?
              Without a doubt!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lagos is surrounded by water on all sides. Beaches are just
              stunning! In these lovely sandy places, picnics and beach
              activities are acceptable. With their powdered white dunes,
              gorgeous blue ocean, and palm palms, they are incredibly
              appealing. The best advantage is that they are rarely crowded,
              save on weekends and holidays.
